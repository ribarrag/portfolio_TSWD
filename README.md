# Portfolio TSWD

This is my portfolio from Telling Stories with Data (94-870)

It consists of a number of graphs and graph critiques developed during a seven weeks class, and a final project.

The final project includes three reports that consist on: 
1. Part I: pitch for final presentation, including datasets.
2. Part II: narrative, sketches, wireframes, storyboards and moodboards.
3. Part III: final deliverable and changes from Part II.
