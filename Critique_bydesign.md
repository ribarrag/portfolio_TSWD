# Critique by design

I have selected the following graph to critique. It appeared in a report from the Congressional Budget Office.
The original can be found in [this report](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-09/58426-Inflation.pdf) (p. 6).

</div>

I don't think it is a terribly bad designed graphed: actually, it presents interesting, truthful and complete data. However, ...  

- In my opinion, the information is not presented in a very intuitive way: it contains different shapes for different years, so the user’s eyes must travel back and forth to check which year belongs with which shape. 
- Additionally, it is not very clear what the gray area means in the context of this graph. 
- Although the main message that the authors wanted to convey was that the highest inflation was that of energy goods and services and of durable goods, there is nothing in the graph that highlights those categories.
- I think that, aesthetically, it is a clean graph only using gray and white in the background, without many gridlines; however, it could be perceived as slightly busy with many shapes. 
- The graph could also benefit from a better use of color and a more engaging title.
- I think that the primary audience for this graph are specialists in public finances. In this sense, I think the graph is effective at reaching its audience. However, the reports from the Congressional Budget Office are oftentimes used for informing “lay people”. If this graphed were presented to someone who is interested in this information but doesn’t have a technical background, then I think it could use some improvements to make it more clear, digestible and engaging.
     - For instance, the use of abbreviations as CPI-U for the labels might not be easy to interpret for a general audience. 
- I would add a more engaging title
- I would rotate the graph so inflation is on the y axis
- Instead of shapes, I would use bars
- I would also use a dotted line to represent the average instead of a new shape (or bar) 

## Draft with comments
From my critique, I crafted the following graph, which I then showed to 2 separate participants.

## Comments from surveys
Some of the comments from the surveys are incluided in the draft as comments in <span style="color: green">green</span>

### First (male, consultant, early 30s)
- **Can you tell me what you think this is?**
A graph for inflation in the US, I can tell that from reading the title.

- **Can you describe to me what this is telling you?**
Telling me that energy inflation is very bad and durable goods. 

- **Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?**
Why is the energy inflation negative for the first period and then among the highest? The axis might not be symmetrical, perhaps that is influencing my perception
One of the years is 2022, however we do not have complete information for 2022. I would recommend including a note explaining that the data are either estimates or up to a certain month in the year.

- **Who do you think is the intended audience for this?**
For either people trained in Economics, or also people who are interested in knowing where inflation rates have ben higher during the past years.

- **Is there anything you would change or do differently?**
Discard the repeated years in the x axis. Perhaps only leave the first one, people will infer that it is the same case for the rest, and the graph might look cleaner.


### Second (female, student, late 20s)
- **Can you tell me what you think this is?**
A chart showing high inflation trend for energy and durable goods in America.

- **Can you describe to me what this is telling you?**
At first glance, it seems that the energy and other goods sectors have seen rising inflation since 2020. I don't understand why only these two categories are colored because inflation has also increased for the first two categories; overall and food.

- **Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?**
I don't understand what the sub-categories mean for energy i.e. goods and services. I also find it odd that the overall inflation is presented as a category whereas it is actually an aggregate trend of all the categories. 

- **Who do you think is the intended audience for this?**
Perhaps economists, policy practioners and business owners in America.

- **Is there anything you would change or do differently?**
I would add a note explaining what each category and sub-category means.
I would not consider the 2019 observation for the average of inflation, as it is not included in the data depicted in the graphs, I think it is a bit counterintuitive to include it when computing the average.

## Final version
The final version is a second round of adjustments, that took into account some of the comments gathered from the two participants:
